# Python Guessing Game

Yet another python console app. This one's a guessing game. Through the _random mondule_, a random number between 1 and 9 is generated. The user is then prompted to enter their guess. If the number is too high or too low, the console tells them so. When the user enteres the correct number, they'll be notified in the console and be told how many attempts it took.

I found this exercise <a href="http://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/04/02/09-guessing-game-one.html">here</a>. Full disclosure: This one gave me some trouble so I relied fairly heavily on the solution provided.
